Documentation of Exercise1:

Approach:

The Python script reads the input CSV file containing employee data using the pandas library.
It then derives the 'Effective Date' and 'End Date' for each historical record, ensuring there's no overlap by setting the end date one day before the next effective date.
Missing data is handled by forward filling values from the most recent past record for the same employee.
Columnar data is transformed into a row-based format where each row represents a specific period with consistent data.
Finally, the transformed data is written into a new CSV file formatted for historical data analysis.

Assumptions:

The script assumes a one-year period for each historical record.
Missing data is assumed to be forward filled from the most recent past record for the same employee.
The 'End Date' for the latest record of an employee is assigned a far-future date (e.g., 2100-01-01).
